				<p>
					I'm a longtime Roblox community member and creator advocate.
					Studio&nbsp;Elttob is my personal brand for the products I
					independently create and sell on Roblox.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to make tools that you can feel good about using, and
					set a positive example for how to run a sustainable, organic,
					creator-focused business.

				<p>
					The goal of Studio&nbsp;Elttob is to explore experimental
					directions and pursue new paradigms to enable uniquely powerful
					modes of creations.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the heart of the design process, I analyse each part of the
					creation workflow. I look to tackle existing problems in new
					ways, searching for distinctive or overlooked design ideas.

				<p>
					Every moment you use a Studio&nbsp;Elttob product, you should
					feel like a human spent a lot of time to get every detail right.
					I strive to present my craft with pride.
				</p>
				<p>
					That's why I focus a lot of effort on design. Everything
					in the portfolio isn't just functional, but beautiful. When it
					just works and just clicks, it's just right.

				<p>
					Products these days are tiring. From exaggerated marketing to
					broken trust, there's a lot of turbulence and lost hope.
					I don't want Studio&nbsp;Elttob to be a part of this.
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to build a good-old set of things that are truly your
					own, respecting your intelligence and your time. You should feel
					good about software again; it shouldn't be a game of chess.
